## Test Repo for Experimentation
This repository was created by me to check out all the new features of _Git_ and _Github_.  
And also because I'm still learning version control systems (embarrassing, **I know**).  
But I did learn how to use Markdown in 5 minutes from [this tutorial](www.markdowntutorial.com), so that's a plus.  
Markdown was... _easy_?
